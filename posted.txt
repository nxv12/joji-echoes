I’m just a thought you left behind. -Joji
Replicate this moment from a million miles away. -Joji
I just can’t get over you. -Joji
I don’t wanna be alone. -Joji
I’m not strong enough to let you go. -Joji
I’m drowning in silence. -Joji
You wanted me, not my heart. -Joji
I’m fading into the background. -Joji
Will he love you like I could?. -Joji
I’ll pick up the pieces later. -Joji
I’m not what you need. -Joji
I’ve been fading out for a while now. -Joji
I gave you everything, you gave me nothing. -Joji
Pixelated kisses got me goin' insane. -Joji
I keep pretending I’m fine. -Joji
Falling through the atmosphere right now. -Joji
I’m fading into silence. -Joji
I don’t know how to feel anymore. -Joji
