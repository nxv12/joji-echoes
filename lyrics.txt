I don’t wanna be alone. -Joji
Will he love you like I could?. -Joji
You don’t really care for me. -Joji
I gave you all my love. -Joji
I’m scared of being happy. -Joji
I miss the way you looked at me. -Joji
I’m tired of pretending. -Joji
I’m drowning in silence. -Joji
I’m not who I used to be. -Joji
I’m sorry I couldn’t be enough. -Joji
I thought that I was wrong, but I was right about us. -Joji
I don’t want a friend, I want my life in two. -Joji
I feel like I’m just a ghost. -Joji
I wish you loved me like I love you. -Joji
I’m losing my mind slowly. -Joji
I’ll see you in my dreams. -Joji
I hate that I need you. -Joji
I’m fading into the background. -Joji
I can do this face to face but I’ll admit that I’m afraid. -Joji
Pixelated kisses got me goin' insane. -Joji
Replicate this moment from a million miles away. -Joji
If you never hear from me, all the satellites are down. -Joji
Falling through the atmosphere right now. -Joji
Baby, are you really down?. -Joji
I took a test drive with my feelings. -Joji
I just can’t get over you. -Joji
You wanted me, not my heart. -Joji
I don’t know how to feel right now. -Joji
I’ll pick up the pieces later. -Joji
All you want is attention. -Joji
1AM thoughts won’t leave. -Joji
Stay until the day is over. -Joji
Watch me dissolve into the night. -Joji
I would die for you. -Joji
I’ll see you in forty. -Joji
Don’t leave me here alone. -Joji
I’m just a shadow of what I used to be. -Joji
I’m not okay, I’m not alright. -Joji
I’m scared of what I’ll find in me. -Joji
I’ve been fading out for a while now. -Joji
I don’t know how to feel anymore. -Joji
I’m stuck in a loop I can’t escape. -Joji
I gave you everything, you gave me nothing. -Joji
I’m not the one you dream about. -Joji
I’m falling through the cracks again. -Joji
I wish I could forget your face. -Joji
I’m tired of chasing ghosts. -Joji
I’m not strong enough to let you go. -Joji
I keep pretending I’m fine. -Joji
I’m just noise in the background. -Joji
I’m not worth the fight. -Joji
I’m losing pieces of myself. -Joji
I’m afraid of being forgotten. -Joji
I’m not the same when you’re not around. -Joji
I’m drowning in memories. -Joji
I’m just a placeholder in your life. -Joji
I’m not what you need. -Joji
I’m falling apart quietly. -Joji
I’m not enough for you. -Joji
I’m just a name you used to know. -Joji
I’m scared of being real. -Joji
I’m fading into silence. -Joji
I’m not the one you cry for. -Joji
I’m just a thought you left behind. -Joji
