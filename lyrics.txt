Slow dancing in the dark — Joji
Do you ever think of me? — Joji
I don’t wanna be alone — Joji
Tell me what you need from me — Joji
I need you, baby, mm — Joji
Come on, baby, take my hand — Joji
You don’t really care for me — Joji
You wanted me, not my heart — Joji
I just can’t get over you — Joji
Let’s go for a test drive, baby — Joji
Will he love you like I could? — Joji
I’m in the mood for you — Joji
I’ll pick up the pieces later — Joji
I don’t know how to feel right now — Joji
You’re a pretty boy, yeah — Joji
We’re not normal people, no — Joji
You were the afterthought I needed — Joji
They don’t know the things I’ve done — Joji
Bring me back to life, reanimator — Joji
The way you move, like you do — Joji
I’ve been feeling like the end — Joji
I would die for you — Joji
Stay until the day is over — Joji
Watch me dissolve into the night — Joji
Riding through the night — Joji
I can’t hear you over the noise — Joji
1AM thoughts won’t leave — Joji
All you want is attention — Joji
I’ll see you in forty — Joji
Don’t leave me here alone — Joji
